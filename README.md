<h1>Vulnerability Management (Nessus)</h1>
This tutorial will cover vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on a VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation..<br />


<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
- Dowload VMware or a similar VM software, Have a windows ISO, Create a Nessus essentials account.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMware (Virtual Machines)
- Nessus Scanning Tool

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Create Windows 10 VM with bridged NIC
- Disable User Account Control
- Perform a non-credential scan of windows
- Perform a credentialed scan of windows

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
After setting up VMware make sure to set your Windows 10 VM to bridged NIC to make it easier to run the Nessus scan from your main PC.
Memory, Processors and HD space is up to you but if you aren't sure what your system can handle leave the defaults.

<p>
Perform a non credential scan of windows. This brings back a limited amount of vulnerabilities.

<p>
After adding your Windows credentials to Nessus and running another scan you will encounter a lot more vulnerabilites.

By clicking on the remediation tab in Nessus we can see some reccomendations on how to tackle some of the vulnerabilities. In the case of this project you can see a large number of vulnerabilities can be fixed by doing windows updates.
